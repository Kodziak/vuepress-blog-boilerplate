But first, we need to explain to each other one thing. What the heck productivity exactly is? 

<!-- more -->

### What is productivity?

Productivity is not when you're doing everyday coding for one hour, reading books, and training. It's not until you don't get from it what you wanted. If we're reading a book and doing nothing with new knowledge - it's bad. It's not mean you're productive then, you've just wasted your time. 

In my opinion, productivity means getting things done. If you have a list with many tasks, productive is when you will clean this list - which means you made all the tasks which you had to.

### What gives us productivity?

We all procrastinate. In work. Usually. I feel you, we all had days when we do nothing. But I think - there's no point.

Being productive at work most of the time leads us to earn more money. We all love money. When you deliver your tasks in time, doing solid work (delivering fast (mostly when your time task ends) != solid work), and shows, that you're reliable worker - possibility to get rise growing. 

But that's not all.

#### Productivity admins you to get more free time

It sounds ridiculous, right? But imagine, that you had ten tasks to do. If you've focused on them and end at 5-6 pm, you will have the almost full evening free. Probably without planning tasks, and focusing on them - you wouldn't perform them all.

### How I'm doing

I love thinking about me that I'm productive. I'm daily trying to reach my list done, read few pages of a book, write some lines of code, but it isn't always working well. By now, I have 5+ tasks to-do, but I'm not sad about this. I will get them done - but in time. 

My typical flow is easy. If I have something to do, I'm adding a task to my to-do list app (I will explain later which software I'm using), and when I have some time I'm trying to get one of them done.

One small hint: you can categorize your tasks. If you have something short (ex. 2-minute task), mark it as `#short`. And when you will have some short amount of time -> you can do one from this tasks. For example, send an email could be a task like this.

### My productivity tools

I'm using just a few applications. Didn't wanted my app base to grow, so I've always trying to find complex software.

#### TickTick

It's my to-do list application. I love UI design and MacOS shortcut (CMD + Shift + A) to fast add tasks. Also, TickTick allows us to create lists (really recommend), which will group your tasks by whatever you want. Also, we can use reminders. If I have a task which I've to do next Monday -> no problem, just pick a time and task will appear in your list this day.

TickTick has many more cool features. Probably a much better explanation of what you can do with this application you will find on their website.

#### Evernote

Previously I've used Google Keep, but some time ago I've moved to Evernote. It was the best decision I've made to improve my system. You can fast add short notes (this is a feature killer) and create them on the fly. Also, like in TickTick - you can create lists to aggregate your notes. It's cool, I've made some groups which makes it easy to find a note which I need.

Evernote has many more cool features. All of them, you can find on their website.

#### RescueTime

I've used this software for some weeks - not longer. I've never imagined how much time I've wasted watching YouTube or surfing in Reddit like websites.

The idea of this application is to show you where you're wasting time. This collects what you're doing (working in the background) and one a week sends you a weekly report where you can find how many percents per category you have spent time. Application is available in macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows, so you can use it everywhere.
